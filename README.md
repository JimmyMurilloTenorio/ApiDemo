# ApiDemo

This repository contains an example of an API built with ASP.NET Core. The API includes three types of routes: a public route, an authorized route, and an authenticated route. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to set up and use authentication and authorization in an ASP.NET Core application.

## Features

- **Public Route**: Accessible by anyone without authentication.
- **Authorized Route**: Requires a valid JWT token to access.
- **Authenticated Route**: Requires user authentication.
